HTTP endpoints FTW!!!

* What router do we use?

We use [[https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter][github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter]]

Here is the trivial example of a server, you can run yourself.

Start the server by clicking *Run* and then goto [[http://localhost:8080/][Index endpoint]] to see the 'Welcome!' message.

Next, try the [[http://localhost:8080/hello/go%20developers][Hello endpoint with 'go developers' appended]]
